NOTE:
If you login using your Google credentials, you cannot only make changes to your profile from your main Google account.

Below are explanations on how core functionalities of this app work. APP LAUNCH: When the app starts, it checks if there is an existing session:

    If there is one, it checks the authentication provider, if it's "google.com, it navigates immediately to the home screen. If the provider is "password", it navigates immediately to the verification page and a 5 digit pin is sent to the user's email and they provide the code and if it is correct, they get authenticated and navigated to the home screen.

    If there is no active session, the user then choose to login with email and password and follow MFA procedure or login using their Google credentials or create a new account.

    PASSWORD RESET WHEN PASSWORD IS FORGOTTEN
    When the user clicks the "forgot password" button, the user is asked to provide the email address they used in creating an account with, if there is an account associated with this email, a password reset link is sent to them which they can click on an a password reset page will then open. Then the user will be prompted to enter a new password, once it is registered, the user can then use it as the new password.

    PASSWORD RESET WHEN LOGGED-IN
    When a user is authenticated, if the user wants to change the password, the user gets verified one more time, then a password reset option within the app is provided which then lets the user change the password.

    OTP Code Expiry
    Whenever a OTP is sent to the user's email, the users has 60 seconds to input it before ir expires. The user is provided with a OTP resend code button each time the code expires.

    OTP Code Resend
    The current OTP code has to expire before a new one is sent. The user gets a counter on the screen telling them how much time is left before a new OTP is resent if they click the resend button.

    NOTE
    When the user clicks the back button continuously and arrives the login page, the user automatically gets logged out of the app. There the backstack gets emptied in case there are still some screens available in the navigation stack.

    Authentication Start timer
    The timer starts as soon as the user starts typing into the input fields. If the user leaves the authentication process incomplete the timer will keep counting until the user comes and complete it. It can take days, weeks months, years, the timer will keep track as long as the user does not uninstall and reinstall the app.
        the timer gets reset once the user gets to the home screen.
        The timer also gets reset when the app runs and checks if the timer is set to true if it is set to true while the user is in the login screen, it gets reset again.

    HANDLING STATES
        Sharepreferences is being used to handle the states, such as if a user is logged-in, logged-out, returning active user, if the authentication process is complete. These state handlers work work with Viewmodels to make sure data persists across screens and mainly when a reconfiguration occurs through out the life cycle of the application.
